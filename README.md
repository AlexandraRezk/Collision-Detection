# Collision-Detection
I expanded on the tutorial I used in my Running-Sprite-Animation Repository from Simplified Coding. I made a sprite that can walk up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys. I used a different sprite sheet than the one provided in the tutorial.

I also tried to find a sprite sheet with an idle position, but that proved difficult to find. So instead of an idle position, when the character stops moving I made the upward animation be it's default position when no keys are being pressed.

Now I am making a pop up happen whenever the sprite collides with the blue box on the screen. I am having some difficulty with making the sprite stop moving after it collides with the box. 

Here is a link to the tutorial: https://www.simplifiedcoding.net/javascript-sprite-animation-tutorial-html5-canvas/
